Antonio Holmes is a Junior Data Sciencist who attends John Hopkins University under Pre-Med tracks. She's used throughout the Chromebook Data Science Course Set. She's particularly interested in both introducing the field of data science to anyone and everyone and teaching others how to do data science. Since she's fictional, she doesn't have any cool projects to tell you about or some interesting background information or interests to share, but if she did, she'd add them here.
